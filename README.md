# Dice Game

"Dice Game" is an easy to play userfriendly game for anyone who is looking for a nice passtime without having to concentrate too much, for example when using public transportation or taking a break.The user gets to play against the computer. In clicking a single button, the player and the computer simultaneously throw two dice and the result shows both the player's as well as the computer's score. The throw with the higher number wins the round and gains one point. Whoever has 15 points first, wins the game. The user is then offered to play again which is provided also with the click of one button. The game is programmed with Java Script and the website designed with HTML/CSS.

## Features
"Dice Game" includes two pages. The first page is the introduction site and the second one the game itself. In the following sectors I will go into details for each site individually.

### Introduction Page
This section provides an overview with simple instructions for the user.
 The heading contains the title of the name, which is "Dice Game"
The main includes the instructions for the game as well as the "Play" button.
The footer provides the contact information of the developer for the user. 

### Game Area
This section will allow the user to play the "Dice Game". 

On the top of the page the user can read the title of the game again.

Underneath are two pictures, each show two dice. Each picture shows the score of each dice throw, the left one shows the computer's score, the one on the right the user's score (which is zero for both at the start of the game, since none of the players has thrown the dice yet.)

Inbetween the pictures it shows the score that adds up the score of each round (as in dice throw) for both players. The user will see how many points they got as well as how many points the computer got. 

Below that there is the "Throw Dice" button, easily to find for the user.

In the footer the user gets the options of clicking the "Restart" button or the "Home" button, both easily to identify with added symbols. 

At the end of the game, meaning either the computer or the user reached 15 points altogether, the user is shown an alert telling them that the game ist over and if they won or lost. The user has to click the "Okay" button on the alert. The screen than shows the result of the game again and the user then gets to choose whether to play again or go back to the homepage.
